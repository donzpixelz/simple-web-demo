### Response
To send the last three terminal commands you typed into a text file on your Mac desktop, follow these steps:

1. **Open Terminal**: Ensure the Terminal app is open.

2. **Retrieve the Last Three Commands**: You can use the `history` command to display recent commands. To get the last three, run:
   ```bash
   history 3
